# Planning

## Value Indicators

Trackable metric for success. Each priority should move a value indicator. Estimate the current state of the indicator. If you're a hotdog stand these could be:
* Days in a month spent on grill maintenance - currently 5 days/month.
* Time between customer ordering and receiving hotdog - currently 10 mins.
* Weekly 5* Reviews of hotdogs - currently 3/week.

The idea is not too focused (you want team/cross team scope to impact, not the sole responsibility of an individual) and not too high level as to be all encompassing. A metric such as "Number of hotdogs sold" is too vague as all the above metrics could contribute to improving this, so focus in on individual contributing factors. These should be quantifiable. e.g. you can stop watch time between customer ordering and getting the hotdog.



## Priorities

With an estimate of the current state of this value indicator, you can evaluate how priorities would improve this indicator. How does the team determine priorities?

Select people in the organisation and ask (similar to onboarding strategy) "What are the challenges with what you do?", "What slows you down?" & "Who should I talk to?". Get the user pain points with current system. Derive from this the outcomes that will move the business forward. At this stage focus on problems not solutions. Include a stakeholder assessed "impact" number indicating how important you perceive this to be. E.g. (hot dog stand again)
* People bunch up around the stand making it hard to tell whose ordered yet - 5
* Hotdogs stick to the grill and burn - 2
* People want mustard - 1
* ... there should be lots of these!

Assess each with the technical team to assess a notion of what could be done (hunches, not full solutions) and how much effort that would be. Tee shirt size the Priority to indicate effort. "Not sure would require investigation" is perfectly valid and the effort number can reflect this.

## Capacity Assessment

Man hours x weeks in Quarter = weeks of capacity. Compare against your tee shirt sized key priorities.
```
XS - 1 day
S - 0.5 week
M - 1 week
L - 2 week
XL - > 2 Weeks
```

## Bets Analogy

Whats included in the plan is a bet. You want fewer larger, more uncertain "bets" and more smaller more certain deliverables. Go for "guaranteed horses". In any work there is assumptions. Information will evolve therefore the work required will. Your ability to estimate will improve iterating on this process.

## The plan

Assess your priorities against the value indicators and estimate how much they could improve. E.g.

"People bunch up around the stand making it hard to tell whose ordered yet" impacts "Time between customer ordering and receiving hotdog". Impact of 5 according to stakeholders. there are many solutions: enforce a queue, use a ticketing system, etc. Investigation is required to see which is most impactful. L to model these options.

"Hotdogs stick to the grill and burn" impacts "Days spent on grill maintenance". Impact of 2 according to stakeholders. Possible solution is use more oil. S to implement and test. Would reduce days spent on maintenance by 2 days / month moving the value indicator from 5 to 3.

Use a table with appropriate headers.

Of the two assessed  one is a good bet: small, well scoped and clear. The other has potential for greater impact, but requires investigation and is more uncertain. We want mostly to be doing guaranteed wins, but shouldn't shy away from a more risky bet especially with high impact. Now we are in a better place to decide what to do next.

## Iteration

You only need to plan the next sprint. Then reassess against value metrics in a retro ritual & iterate.

Do this based on learning / wins / questions / blockers.

* Learning, customers hate queuing and prefer the ticket system.
* Win, we're now using more oil, less hotdogs sticking.
* Question, where can I buy cheap tickets?
* Blocker, hotdog van has a flat tyre.

These allow you to evolve direction of movement based on reflecting on completed work's impact on priorities.

### Ideas I didn't manage to include

* Context, decision & action within 1 informed person
* Competing interests
