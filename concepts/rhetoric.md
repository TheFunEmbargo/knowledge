# Story telling

To tell a story, pick a shape to punctuate with appeal and a narrative then speil.

## Shape: Kurt Vonnegut 

[From the dogs mouth.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oP3c1h8v2ZQ)

- “Be a sadist. No matter how sweet and innocent your leading characters, make awful things happen to them — so the reader may see what they're made of.”
- “It’s not accidental that the line ends up higher than where it began. This is encouraging to readers.” (True for 6 of the 8)
- “The shape of the curve is what matters. Not their origins.”

1. **Man in Hole**  
   A character’s doing fine, gets herself into a huge problem, and must overcome it. They end up better than they started.  
   *Example — Die Hard.*

2. **Boy Meets Girl**  
   The protagonist finds something wonderful (usually love), loses it, and then goes on a journey to get it back again.  
   *Example — The Proposal.*

3. **From Bad to Worse (Kafkaesque)**  
   The protagonist starts off bad but things manage to get worse from there. Sometimes, you turn into a bug.  
   *Example — Metamorphosis.*

4. **Which Way is Up? (The Complicated One)**  
   The character(s) goes through a series of seemingly random ups and downs. Often, the overall line slopes up despite the constant zigzag.  
   *Example — Game of Thrones.*

5. **Creation Story**  
   This represents the idea of coming out of chaos and moving toward order and happiness. The shape slopes upwards but isn’t common in western culture.  
   *Example — The Lion King.*

6. **Old Testament**  
   Characterized by cycles of good fortune and bad fortune, but typically ends in a downward direction. Think of it as a series of ups and downs that finally go down.  
   *Example — No Country for Old Men.*

7. **New Testament**  
   The main character has progressively better fortune until, one day, something horrible happens. Then they have to figure out how to find “off the chart bliss.”  
   *Example — Shawshank Redemption.*

8. **Cinderella (Rags-to-Riches)**  
   I’ll leave this description to Vonnegut:  
   “We’re gonna start way down here. Worse than that, who is so low? It’s a little girl… the shoe fits, and she achieves off-scale happiness.”  
   *Example — Harry Potter.*
